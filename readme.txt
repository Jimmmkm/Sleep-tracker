6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
I didn't specifically design an app for a particular type of user, just focused on designing an application for recording 
overnight sleep and sleepiness.


7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
It is designed for iOS.


8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
Click "log overnight sleep" button on the homepage because this can help users record their length of sleep easily.


9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
Click "log sleepiness" button on the homepage because this can help users record their extents of sleepiness easily without
redirecting another pages.


10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
Click the button "view all records" near the "most recent record" card because it can make the page be more organized, especially
two components are related to logged data.


11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?
We used backing up logged data.


12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?
We didn't add a native device resource.


13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?
It backs up to Capacitor Storage, a local database on the website, from Ionic.

14. How does your app implement or follow principles of good mobile design?
For each page, we included "back" button to return to the page before; both "sleepiness" button and "overnight sleep" button
are able to change the date of recording and submit records flexibly. Also, all stored records won't be eliminated after
refreshing unless the user clicks "trash" button to clear all records.
